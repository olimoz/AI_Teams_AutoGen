    "## Give AutoGen Teams Jupyter Notebooks for Agile Code Development (and a record of the conversation)\n",
    "\n",
    "by [Oliver Morris](https://linkedin.com/in/olimoz)\n",
    "10 December 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous work it has become clear that teams of LLMs, as enabled by MS AutoGen, produce their best solutions when iterating towards a solution. This means, proposing small pieces of code, executing them to confirm validity and progress towards a solution, then recifying before proceeding. The success of this approach is not surprising, it is both true of people (see agile methodologies) and a cause of the popularity of Jupyter notebooks. Furthermore, it is a reflection of the ReAct (reason then act) approach, which is offered as a [LangChain agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, AutoGen's coding environment does not encourage iterative development. It is not stateful, the variables and functions defined in previous steps of a conversation are not easily available to later steps. However, such a stateful environment is available via [Microsoft TaskWeaver](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver), many await integration of the TaskWeaver agent into Autogen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, there is a another and simple way for an AutoGen team to code in a stateful environment, whilst also retaining the narrative of the conversation. We can present the Executor of the team as a Jupyter notebook. Conversation messages become markdown cells, code messages become code cells. As the team progress from one cell to another, the variables and functions developed in previous cells remain available to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, this approach of using the Executor to represent an environment is demonstrated in an official AutoGen example. In that example, a member of the team is a [chess board](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_chess.ipynb) for other team members to play on.\n",

    "## Provision of a New Working Environment for the Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally the Executor is a instance of AutoGen's UserProxy class. So, we take the following approach:\n",
    "- Subclass UserProxy with a new class, NotebookExecutor\n",
    "- Provide the key functions to manage a notebook:\n",
    "    - insert_cell\n",
    "    - update_cell\n",
    "    - view_cell\n",
    "    - etc\n",
    "- Use UserProxy's 'register_reply' method to submit code and receive responses from the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the environment in which this notebook executes is provided by the 'kernel_manager'. In this instance we use the 'python3' kernel which has access to the same packages installed in the conda environment executing this notebook. This solution is intended to be as simple as possible. Additional work would be required to enable to notebook cells to execute in a different environment, eg Docker, and to use the shell to install packages in that environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Python has been hardcoded as the language for notebooks. This can be changed but would require further work to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, this new class has only been tested within the context of this notebook. It inherits many methods from the parent class (USerProxy) which are not used in this notebook. Those methods HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED. "
