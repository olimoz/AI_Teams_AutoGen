    "## Give AutoGen Teams Jupyter Notebooks for Agile Code Development (and a record of the groupchat)\n",

    "A team of agents should be able to plan and code via a Jupyter Notebook. This has the benefits of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stateful environment\n",
    "- Code cells are executed immediately and any errors or hallucinations are uncovered for fixing\n",
    "- The team can respond to outputs from cells as part of their groupchat\n",
    "    - i.e. preplanning all steps is not required and the team can act in an agile manner\n",
    "- The notebook records both groupchat and code\n",
    "    - making the notebook a self explanatory log of the steps taken to reach the final output\n"

    "    - https://youtu.be/iF2RguoqmrA\n",

    "The implementation was broad, permitting agents to carry out the following actions on any cell in the notebook:\n",
    "\t- Insert new cell\n",
    "\t- Update cell contents\n",
    "\t- View cell (i.e. return contents to groupchat)\n",

    "### ISSUES WITH PRIOR \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heavy use of system prompts instructing the agents on how they should communicate their intent to the notebook executor, e.g what cell to act on and whether to view, insert, update or delete a cell\n",
    "    - These lengthy system prompts made the implementation fragile, the LLM need not always follow such instructions and indeed only GPT-4-Turbo was reliable.\n",
    "    - The LLM had to wrap the the following in unique identifiers, which it frequently failed to do:\n",
    "        - cell id '@@@'\n",
    "        - action to be taken, '^^^'\n",
    "        - code to be executed, '```' \n",
    "    - Furthermore, it was cumbersome for developers to adapt to their own use cases, they would have to adapt lon system prompts, even minor changes could cause unforeseen problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Although GPT-4-Turbo was the model model to follow the prompt instructions, it only ever used a subset of the actions possible in a notebook; \"Insert a new cell\" and \"Update cell\", when an error was reported\n",
    "    - Acting on any cell in the notebook may have been too ambitious    \n",
    "    - Furthermore, it may have caused problems if the team updated a cell in the middle of the notebook, but did not re-execute all the cells thereafter.\n",
    "    - In fact with such a broad range of actions permissible on any cell, chances were high of the notebook becoming impossible to follow\n"

    "### PROPOSED OBJECT MODEL\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the New Code Executors Model, see:\n",
    "    - https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/pull/1405/files\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this approach, most of the code executor's functionality is not directly created in the UserProxyAgent, but instead in a new executor class which subclasses 'base'. This new executor includes a sublass called a 'Capability'. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then create an agent as normal to be our executor, we provide a 'code_execution_config' at initialisation. This states what type of executor the agent will have, 'notebook' in our case:\n",
    "\n",
    "    code_execution_config={'executor': 'notebook'}\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent using this executor will include a line of code \n",
    "\n",
    "    self._code_executor = CodeExecutorFactory.create(self._code_execution_config)\n",
    "\n",
    "The new executor's functionality is then automatically added to the agent via a 'UserCapability' class belonging to the executor. This capability class includes a 'add_to_agent()' method called at instantiation. That method appends the calling agent's system message with the executor's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the new conversable agent class also includes the following method by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "    _generate_code_execution_reply_using_executor\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will be used to call the logic for coding in notebooks. \n",
    "It becomes available to the agent by adding this line to the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    self.register_reply(autogen.ConversableAgent, \n",
    "                        autogen.ConversableAgent._generate_code_execution_reply_using_executor)\n",

    "### PROPOSAL FOR OFFERING NO CHOICE OF ACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove redundant executor code which was not called by the agents AND to prevent corrupution of the notebook, we ensure that all code is simply appended to the end of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t- There is no option to update, delete or view cells anywhere in the notebook\n",
    "\t- All code is appended to end of notebook and executed automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "- PROS\n",
    "\t- No need to implement method for agent to either identify the relevant cell or the action they want to carry out\n",
    "\t- **Hence there is no need for the LLM to be capable of function calls, nor to follow prompts for wrapping important text with a marker**\n",
    "\t- Any LLM capable of coding could engage in such a process\n",
    "- CONS\n",
    "\t- Does not take advantage of any future model (GPT5?) which could wisely use unconstrained choices\n"
